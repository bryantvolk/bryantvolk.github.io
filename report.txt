1. A de jure standard is a standard that is developed and approved by an official 
organization. For example the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers(IEEE) has 
the authority to create electrical standards such as wireless communication. This is 
relevant to computer networking because wireless communication is now an integral 
part of networking.

A de facto standard is a standard so widely used that it is considered the standard even 
though it has no official recognition. An example would be the QWERTY keyboard, 
which is by far the most common keyboard pattern countries with a Latin-based 
alphabet.

The difference between de facto standards and de jure standards is simple. De jure 
standards are approved by an official organization and de facto standards are “the 
vernacular” of standards, meaning they are so common place that they have become 
standards through their popularity.

2. The Internet Engineering Task Force(IETF) is a very prevalent standards body. 
Anyone can actively participate in the IETF. To get involved it is common practice to first 
join the mentoring program where your integration into the IETF community will be 
aided through advice, help, and collected wisdom. Then an interested person would join 
a working group mail list(either one or many) whose topics are interesting or relevant. 
The standards process is straightforward and ends with a completed standard. A 
specification undergoes a period of development and several iterations of review by the 
Internet community and revision based upon experience. It is then adopted as a 
standard by the appropriate body and is published. The organization holds leverage 
through the approval of other organizations and it’s widespread respect.
