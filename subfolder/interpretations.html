			<p>As you probably know by now, <em>Vaporwave</em> is the culmination of many different artforms.<br>
			It combines the physical aesthetic with retro sound remixed to appeal to a lethargic and depressed society.<br>
			Music critic Adam Harper of Dummy Mag has described it as, "a degrading of commercial music," in an attempty to reveal the,
			"false promises,"of modern day capitalism. He goes on to describe it[<em>Vaporwave</em>] as, "ironic and satirical or truly accelerationist."</p>

		<p>
			In order to truly understand how <em>Vaporwave</em> got it's name, one must understand the concept of vaporware as coined
			by a Microsoft engineer in 1982. Vaporware is an idea or product announced years before it's arrival only to never amount to anything.<br>
			Much like the promises modern society gives to students and young adults, vaporware is merely a tool used to hype the masses into either investing
			or consuming.<br>
			<em>Vaporwave</em> as a genre reflects the frustration of the the underprivledged in a musical form. It's slow binaural beats and remixes of past
			favorites employ strong logos in an argument against the stains of Capitalism.
