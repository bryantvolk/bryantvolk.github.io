	<p>Retroism to many could seem like a complicated idea. Basically it boils down to a distinctive practice in imitating
	fashion, design, or culture from the past.<br>
	This fascination with the retro is what attracts many producors and consumers of <em>Vaporwave</em>. Their combined
	nostalgia for the past and lethargic loathe of modern society combine to ignite a wildfire of imagination.<br>
	The uniqueness of <em>Vaporwave</em> is only matched by it's queer allure of such a small subset of music consumers.</p>
